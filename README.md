## About Me
I'm a **machine learning and reinforcement learning researcher** at the University of Alberta, working closely with [Martha White](https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/) on projects that emphasize the **stability of RL algorithms** in settings where the agent needs to **continually adapt**. 

### Background
I completed my MSc in Computing Science, specializing in **deep continual reinforcement learning** under the guidance of [Adam White](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~amw8/) and Martha White. I‚Äôm also affiliated with:
- [Amii](https://www.amii.ca/) (Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute)
- [RLAI](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) (Reinforcement Learning and Artificial Intelligence Lab)
